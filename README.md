# LinkDeck (with My AI built in)

Your LinkDeck link directory and your free "My AI" assistant, merged into
one site. Same LinkDeck look and link categories as before, with the full
AI toolset — Chat, Web Search, Weather, Radio, Calendar, Scratch Links,
and Files — added as extra tabs in the same navigation bar. Costs **$0**
to run: no OpenAI Realtime API, no credit balance to run out of.

The AI in the Chat tab also knows about every link in your LinkDeck —
ask it something like "what's the link to my radio project" or "where's
my calendar app" and it'll answer with the real URL, instead of saying it
doesn't know. Edit `src/data/linkdeck.js` to add, remove, or update a
link, and both the LinkDeck tabs and the AI's knowledge update together
automatically.

## What's included

- **Chat tab:** text + voice conversation. Voice uses your browser's free
  built-in Web Speech API (speech-to-text and text-to-speech) — no API
  key needed. The "brain" is Google Gemini's free tier. Replies appear
  with a typewriter effect, and your conversation is automatically saved
  in your browser (via localStorage) so refreshing the page doesn't lose
  it. Each AI reply has a "Copy" button, and there's a "Clear history"
  button when you want a fresh start.
- **Voice/text commands:** typed or spoken, the Chat tab recognizes a
  handful of exact phrasings and actually does them instead of just
  talking about them:
  - `play radio from <country>` — plays the top station for that country
  - `weather in <place>` — looks up current conditions anywhere
  - `what day is it` / `what's today's date`
  - `what are my tasks today` / `do I have anything today`
  - `save <something> on <day>` — e.g. "save call the dentist on Friday"

  Anything phrased differently just goes to normal chat — Gemini knows
  about these commands and will tell you the right phrasing rather than
  pretending it did something it can't.
- **Weather tab:** current temperature and conditions for any place on
  Earth, powered by Open-Meteo — completely free, no API key, no signup.
- **Radio tab:** pick a country, get its stations, and play/pause/skip
  with a volume slider — the same free Radio Browser directory
  WorldWave uses. Keeps playing while you switch tabs.
- **Calendar tab:** pick a date, add notes for it, remove them later.
  Saved in your browser's storage, so it's there for good unless you
  clear your browser data — it doesn't sync across devices or browsers,
  though (see "Making it more reliable" below if you want that).
- **Project Links tab:** a holding pen for whatever websites belong to
  your current project — add them as you find them, they stay until you
  remove them.
- **Web Search tab:** real Google search results (titles, links,
  snippets) styled like an actual Google results page, powered by
  SerpApi's free tier.
- **Files tab:** pick any folder on your computer and browse/view its
  HTML, JS, CSS, JSON, Markdown, or text files — read-only, using the
  browser's own File System Access API. Nothing is uploaded anywhere;
  it all happens locally in your browser.
- **Dark mode:** toggle button (🌙/☀️) in the top right of the header,
  remembers your choice.

## 1. Get your free API keys

**Gemini (for chat):**
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
2. Sign in with a Google account, click "Create API key," copy it.

**SerpApi (for the Web Search tab):**
1. Go to https://serpapi.com and sign up for a free account.
2. Copy your API key from your dashboard.

Free tier: 250 searches/month, no credit card required. (Google shut
off "search the entire web" for new Custom Search engines in January
2026, which is why this app uses SerpApi instead — it returns the same
kind of real Google results.)

## 2. Add your keys locally

Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env.local` in this folder,
and fill in both values:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
SERPAPI_KEY=...
```

## 3. Install and run locally

```
npm install
npm install -g vercel   (only needed once, ever)
vercel dev
```

Open the local URL it prints (usually http://localhost:3000) in Chrome.

If you change `.env.local` while `vercel dev` is already running, fully
stop it (Ctrl+C) and run `vercel dev` again — code changes reload
automatically, but new environment variables need a restart.

## 4. Push to GitHub

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

## 5. Deploy on Vercel

1. vercel.com → "New Project" → import your GitHub repo.
2. Leave the auto-detected Vite build settings as-is.
3. Under "Environment Variables," add both keys:
   `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `SERPAPI_KEY` (scoped to All Environments).
4. Click Deploy.

## Notes / limitations

- Voice input/output and the Files tab only work in Chrome-based
  browsers (Edge works too) — this is a browser limitation, not a bug
  in this code. Firefox/Safari don't support these APIs the same way.
- Gemini's free tier has a daily limit; SerpApi's free tier resets
  monthly (250 searches). Weather (Open-Meteo) and Radio (Radio
  Browser) are both fully free with no key and no monthly cap.
  Personal use shouldn't come close to hitting any of these.
- Chat history, the Calendar, and Project Links are all saved
  per-browser (localStorage), not in a shared database — none of them
  will follow you to a different browser or device, and clearing your
  browser's site data would clear them too.
- The voice/text commands (radio, weather, calendar) use pattern
  matching on a handful of specific phrasings, not full natural-language
  understanding — see the exact list above. If a command doesn't work,
  try it closer to that wording; anything else falls back to a normal
  chat reply.
- "Propose AI changes" (editing files with AI) from the original app
  isn't included yet — let me know if you want that added next.

## Making it more reliable / next steps

- **Cross-device calendar/links:** right now they're saved only in one
  browser. If you want your calendar or project links to follow you
  everywhere (phone, laptop, different browsers), the next step is a
  small free database — you already have a Supabase account connected,
  which has a generous free tier for exactly this. Say the word and
  I'll wire it in.
- **A second AI as backup:** if Gemini's daily free limit is ever hit,
  the Chat tab will show an error instead of silently failing. Adding
  a fallback to a second free model (so it keeps working that day) is
  a small follow-up if you want extra reliability.
- I built and reviewed this update in my own sandbox, including running
  the actual command-parsing and date logic through real test cases (not
  just reading the code) — but my sandbox doesn't have general internet
  access, so I could not run `npm install`/`vite build` or make live
  calls to the Weather/Radio APIs from here. Please do the normal
  `npm install` then `vercel dev` check locally before deploying, the
  same way you did for the last update — that's the real test.
